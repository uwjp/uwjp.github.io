## Project Plan
### Topic
I plan to create a *live dashboard*. I have not made a concrete plan for my topic, but am exploring ways to track environmental hazards,
changes, and resource management. My [3rd linked resource](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0msJLRzl1ok) was interesting, particularly the 
coastline extraction using imagery. I am interested to see how similar techniques using imagery could be applied to track the shape and 
sizes of forests, glaciers, and other natural features.

### Data Acquisition
To ensure that data will can be automatically updated on a regular basis, I hope to find a data
source with a **free API** so I can easily automate updates.
